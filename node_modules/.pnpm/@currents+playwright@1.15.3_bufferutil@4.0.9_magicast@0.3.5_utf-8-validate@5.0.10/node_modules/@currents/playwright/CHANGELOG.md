## [1.0.1](https://github.com/currents-dev/currents-playwright/compare/v0.12.2...v1.0.1) (2024-03-26)

### Features

This is a major revamp of the reporter. There are **no breaking changes** in terms of API and configuration, but there are significant changes in the underlying reporting mechanism and the produced output.

- **Full parallel mode support**: set `fullyParallel: true` to enable running individual tests from the [same spec file on different workers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-fully-parallel). Playwright supports multiple levels of concurrency - a test suite can be split between different machines using sharding, and on each individual machine Playwright will spawn parallel workers (according to CPU performance or explicit configuration). The workers will run in parallel, executing the tests (or more precisely, test attempts). By default, Playwright runs the tests of the same spec file serially one after another, but, if the tests are isolated, enabling `fullyParallel: true` will allow running tests from the same spec file in parallel on different workers (or sometimes even on different shards / machines). The most recent version of the reporter is compatible with full parallel mode and will collect the results of concurrent parallel executions.

- **Step-level reporting**: playwright organizes tests executions according to the following hierarchy: Run > Project > Spec File > Test > Attempt > Step. Traditionally, reporters send the results **after** Run completion (sometimes after Spec File completion). It works well in most cases, but.... imagine running a spec file with 10 tests on a CI machine. 9 tests can be completed successfully, but the last test can cause a crash. If we report **after** spec completion, no results will be reported at all, even for 9 completed test. Currents reporter sends the results for each individual step (with some batching applied for better performance). That allows capturing as much information as possible as soon as it's ready. It is super-valuable for debugging failed CI executions, which are often unique and are not easy to reproduce locally.

- **Reporter output and results**: we have refactored the look and the feel of the reporter's console output for more precise and accurate presentation of the execution workflow. A test execution consists of one or more attempts, each attempt can have its own status, errors, stdout and stderr output. [Determining](https://docs.currents.dev/tests/test-status#playwright-test-status) a test's "status" and flakiness requires considering the outcome of all the attempts, the expected status and the execution mode (e.g. ["serial" mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#serial-mode) can generate extra attempts). The new format makes it easier to track the logic behind determining test status, displays individual attempts errors. Additionally, we split the captured output, that can have mixed items from concurrent parallel workers and assign them to the corresponding spec files.

- **Playwright orchestration**: the new CLI tool `pwc-p` improves Playwright CI executions by automatically balancing spec files between CI machines. The balancing uses the data from the previously recorded executions to optimally assign spec files between machines, which allows up to 40% decrease in CI E2E Playwright tests. Please refer to our documentation for more details and instructions.
